# Human-like Behavior & Anti-Spam Features

This document describes the advanced human-like behavior patterns and anti-spam measures implemented in BloggerBot v2.1.

## Overview

To prevent your account from being flagged for spam or automated behavior, BloggerBot now includes sophisticated human-like posting patterns, content diversity controls, and quality filters.

## Key Features

### üïê Smart Posting Scheduler

The posting scheduler prevents spam detection by implementing human-like posting patterns:

- **Minimum delays between posts** (1-72 hours depending on pattern)
- **Daily and weekly posting limits**
- **Preferred posting hours** (9 AM - 6 PM)
- **Random posting skips** (10% chance to skip for natural inconsistency)
- **Progressive delays** based on posting history

### üé® Content Diversity Engine

Ensures your content remains varied and original:

- **Topic categorization** across technology, business, lifestyle, education, entertainment, and news
- **Keyword tracking** to prevent overuse of similar terms
- **Content structure variation** using different writing styles and formats
- **Similarity detection** to avoid repetitive content
- **Writing angle rotation** (how-to guides, trend analysis, comparisons, etc.)

### üõ°Ô∏è Spam Prevention System

Advanced content filtering to avoid spam detection:

- **Spam phrase detection** (removes "click here", "buy now", "limited time", etc.)
- **Excessive punctuation filtering** (limits exclamation marks)
- **Caps lock normalization** (converts excessive capitals)
- **Content quality scoring** (minimum length, uniqueness checks)
- **Promotional language filtering**

## Posting Patterns

Both files are automatically created and managed by the system.

## Migration from Previous Versions

If upgrading from an older version:

1. The bot will automatically create new configuration files
2. No existing functionality is affected
